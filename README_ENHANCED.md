- **Pattern Detection**: Identify coordination patterns across jurisdictions

### **Historical Federal Data Integration**
- **Comprehensive Senate LDA API Integration**: Access to federal lobbying data from 2008-present
- **Quarterly Expenditure Tracking**: Track lobbying investments across multiple quarters
- **Enhanced Company Name Matching**: Fuzzy matching for entity variations (e.g., "Google Inc" vs "Google Client Services LLC")

### **Advanced Analytics & Reporting**
- **Correlation Scoring**: Mathematical correlation analysis between activities
- **Executive Reports**: Professional analysis summaries with strategic insights
- **Excel Export**: Multi-sheet workbooks with detailed breakdowns
- **Timeline Visualization**: Chronological activity mapping across jurisdictions

## üìä Example Analysis: Google Case Study

Based on the enhanced capabilities, here's what a Google analysis reveals:

```
