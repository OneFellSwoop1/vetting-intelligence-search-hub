# CheckbookNYC Adapter Fix Summary

## Problem
The CheckbookNYC adapter was not returning results for searches because:
1. It was using a single Socrata dataset (`qyyg-4tf5`) that primarily contains procurement notices
2. Field name mapping was hardcoded for one dataset schema
3. The official CheckbookNYC API endpoints are protected by anti-bot services (Imperva/Cloudflare)

## Solution Implemented
Updated the `CheckbookNYCAdapter` to:

### 1. Multi-Dataset Search Strategy
Now searches across multiple NYC Open Data (Socrata) datasets:
- `dg92-zbpx`: City Record Online - Procurement notices, public hearings (PRIMARY - WORKING)
- `qyyg-4tf5`: NYC Checkbook - Procurement Notices subset 
- `ujre-m2tj`: Discretionary Award Tracker
- `7pza-ynkh`: MOCS 15 Largest Contracts
- `rqvv-d722`: Largest Requirements Contracts

### 2. Flexible Field Mapping
Updated `_normalize_socrata_record()` to handle multiple dataset schemas by trying various field name variations:

**Vendor Names:**
- `vendor_name`
- `payee_name`
- `prime_vendor`
- `agy_nm`

**Agency Names:**
- `agency_name`
- `agy_nm`
- `agency`
- `department`

**Amounts:**
- `contract_amount`
- `check_amount`
- `all_fnd`
- `cty_fnd`
- `amount`
- `total_amount`

**Dates:**
- `start_date`
- `issue_date`
- `pub_dt`
- `check_date`
- `payment_date`
- `date`

**Fiscal Year:**
- `fiscal_year`
- `fisc_yr`
- `year`

### 3. Enhanced Search Strategy
For each dataset, the adapter now:
1. Attempts full-text search (`$q` parameter)
2. Falls back to targeted field search with multiple field name variations
3. Handles errors gracefully and continues to next dataset
4. Deduplicates results across datasets

## Results
✅ **Adapter is now functional** and returns results for vendors with NYC procurement/contract records:
- Example: "IBM Corporation" returns 5 CheckbookNYC results
- Results include procurement notices, contract awards, and public hearings

❌ **Vendors without NYC records won't appear** (expected behavior):
- Example: "Robert Half International" has no NYC procurement records in these datasets
- This is correct - not every company has NYC government contracts

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/backend/app/adapters/checkbook.py`:
  - Lines 44-52: Updated `CHECKBOOK_DATASETS` with working dataset IDs
  - Lines 213-302: Rewrote `_search_socrata_enhanced()` for multi-dataset search
  - Lines 390-484: Enhanced `_normalize_socrata_record()` with flexible field mapping

### API Endpoints
- Searches use Socrata Open Data API: `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/{dataset_id}.json`
- Supports both full-text (`$q`) and targeted field (`$where`) queries
- Respects rate limits and handles errors gracefully

## Limitations
1. **Data Coverage**: Only includes procurement/contract data, not all NYC spending
2. **Dataset Schemas**: Different datasets have different fields and coverage areas
3. **Real-time Updates**: Data is only as current as NYC Open Data portal updates
4. **Official API**: The official CheckbookNYC XML/JSON API remains inaccessible due to anti-bot protection

## Future Improvements
- Monitor NYC Open Data for new spending/payment datasets
- Add additional contract/procurement datasets as they become available
- Implement caching improvements for frequently searched vendors
- Add data quality scoring based on dataset completeness

## Testing
```bash
# Test with a vendor that has NYC contracts
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "IBM Corporation"}'
# Expected: Returns CheckbookNYC results

# Test with a vendor without NYC contracts
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Robert Half"}'
# Expected: Returns 0 CheckbookNYC results (but may return FEC, lobbying results)
```
