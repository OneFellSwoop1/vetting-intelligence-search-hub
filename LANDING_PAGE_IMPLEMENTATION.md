## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Color Scheme Match**: The landing page uses the EXACT same dark gradient theme as the application (slate-900 → purple-900 → slate-900) to create a cohesive experience.

2. **Glassmorphism**: Heavy use of `backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-white/10`, and `border border-white/20` to match the existing app's modern aesthetic.

3. **Multiple CTAs**: "DEMO NOW" button appears in:
   - Navigation header (always visible)
   - Hero section (primary CTA)
   - Final CTA section (last chance to convert)

4. **Professional Tone**: Enterprise-focused messaging emphasizing security, compliance, and ROI.

5. **Branding**: POISSON AI® with ® symbol consistently used throughout.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add contact form or email signup
- Create pricing page at `/pricing`
- Add customer testimonials
- Implement analytics tracking (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)
- Add video demo or product tour
- Create blog/resources section
- Add dark/light mode toggle (currently dark by default)
- Implement A/B testing for CTAs

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The landing page is designed to:
1. **Convert visitors to users** - Clear CTAs throughout
2. **Build trust** - Enterprise stats, security badges, use cases
3. **Educate prospects** - Comprehensive feature and data coverage sections
